# Seven Star Friend

Welcome to **Seven Star Friend**!  
This repository is dedicated to my six best friends—we always shone brightest when we were together, like seven stars in the sky.

## 🌠 About

There were seven of us, always together, sharing memories and laughter. Now, we've drifted apart, but I want to find my friends again and celebrate our bond.

This project is a small way to reconnect and preserve our memories.
